          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
          <!--<p>Hi, I'm Raphael and thanks for visiting my website. I am currently
            studying computer science at RMIT. I enjoy programming, solving
          problems, and making user interface.</p>-->
          <p>Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
          <p>I was born in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia. Back when I was in high school, maths is my passion. Not only I aced my maths test,
          but I also participated in several competitions and events and won awards.</p>
          <p>My love in maths has helped me to be a developer when I enrolled into Swinburne University of Technology and later transfer to RMIT University.
            I have made amazing websites and applications during my studies.</p>
